A second paper has been published by the same UC/JEPS team referenced in a previous news item on this page (April 11, 2017),  adding phylogenetic methods to the study of diversity and endemism in the California flora.  This novel "spatial phylogenetics" approach makes it possible to evaluate biodiversity from an evolutionary standpoint, including discovering significant areas of neo- and paleo-endemism.

<br>
A new study published by a UC/JEPS team uses distributional data from the CCH and other data portals, diversity metrics, and a randomization test, to map biodiversity and endemism for California native vascular plants. These data are available for research use and includes standardized location and collector names that are not yet avaliable on the CCH.

<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;March-April&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Error and bug fixes</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Updated some broken collector information links on the Acession Details page.</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing composite collection numbers (for example: 12-134-C, CL-123-35) to display as a long-integer (12134C, CL12335).  The number was being reported correctly in database download files in the respective CNUM-prefix, CNUM, and CNUM-suffix fields.  However, this was causing confusing results using some of the advanced search features and the sorting function of the search results table, which only uses the CNUM field data for sorting (in these two cases, 134 and 123, respectively).  The display has been fixed to show a space between the composite number fields, instead of the former display on an unbroken string of numbers and letters.</p>	
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Sorting the date display on the search results page should now be more intuituive since it is displaying a formatted date, not the verbatim date (or the unfomatted date from the home database).  For reference, the unformatted date from the label is displayed on the verbatim date line in the Acession Details page, when present and different from the formatted date.</p>

<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;January 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;JROH, PGM, RSA, UCR updated</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;1. PGM&nbsp;&nbsp; PGM provided the first update in several years.  A new loading script was written for PGM to bring the data up to current standards.
	</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;2. YM&nbsp;&nbsp; Geocoordinates for YM have been appearing as integer degrees and have been highly inaccurate. This was a result of changes and updates to the refresh script for CCH. The loading script for YM has been updated and the geocoordinate problem has been fixed.
</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;3. CSUSB, CLARK, IRVC, LA, MACF, PASA, SACT, UCSB, VVC&nbsp;&nbsp; These participants still have older, out-of-date datasets that are potentially being converted incorrectly when CCH is refreshed.  IRVC has a number of poorly converted coordinates, specifically that are a source of yellow flags.  These are next on the list for loading script updating.
</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Baja Specimens with 'Unknown' Municipalities&nbsp;&nbsp; Since May of 2016, it has been impossible to tell the difference between Baja California records and California records when the county/municipality field is "unknown".
<br /> Further refinement in this refresh has excluded 2-3,000 more specimens from Baja that map outside the CA-FP Baja boundary that also have an 'unknown' municipality.
<br /> Previously, these records were left in CCH, but the coordinates were nulled.  Ultimately, a State and Country field needs to be added to CCH to exclude all of these specimens from searches appropriately.  Until this is done, there will still be specimens from Baja showing up as California specimens with an 'unknown' county.

Cleanup and reassignment of the georeference records for this change is ongoing.  More orphaned georeferences were corrected to the new accession numbers in this refresh.  There are ones that are still problematic. The georeferences are being checked for yellow flags and changed when necessary.

<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;October 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug fixes, no updates</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Fixed a bug where the data was not being created correctly for the GBIF IPT port of the CCH data. Fixed a bug where new records and new determinations were not displaying in the html pages accurately.
</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;2. RSA/POM&nbsp;&nbsp; A bug is still present where certain small subset of specimens are displaying in the wrong family when only a family is searched.
	</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, this update removed additional records from some collections that had missing data in all but the state field.  Also some additional specimens from outside the CA-FP boundary in Mexico (mostly with unknown in the municipality field) were removed from display in the CCH.  David set these specimens up to be included but because the georeferences were outside the CA-FP, the coordinates were nulled.  These records are now being excluded from CCH so they are not confused with specimens within the CA-FP Mexico boundary that have not been georeferenced.

<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;October 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSC, HUH, JOTR, OBI, and SBBG updated</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;1. RSA POM&nbsp;&nbsp;
A new database refresh is still being processed.  This new dataset eliminates the old filemaker program and has all specimens from California in the Specify database.  A future refresh will include these data and include a refresh of the Mexico specimens.  As with CAS, the primary record number will be changed for RSA and POM once these new data are loaded.  The old RSA and POM accession number will be included as an other record number once these data are online.</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid the issue with the CAS georeference buffer, the georeference buffer records using the old RSA/POM accessions will retained until the RSA file has been completely re-formatted and processed. Conversion of the georeference buffer, linking the old accession numbers to the new ones, is ongoing simultaneously.  When the new RSA data is live, the successfully converted georeferences in the buffer will also be live.</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CAS&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Around 200,000 more georeferences from the buffer have been added to this refresh.  The buffer georeferences using the old CAS and DS accession number were linked to the new accession number and loaded into this refresh.  Most, but not all, georeferences were linked to the new record numbers.  There were some that were not found and some that were duplicate accessions.  These georeferences were deleted from the buffer.</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;3. HUH, CAS, RSA&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Due to the time needed for converting the georeference buffer, character formatting errors are still present in these datasets (fractions , degrees, peoples names with special characters, etc displaying as unintelligible character strings).  I will be working on correcting these over the next month.</p>  
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Missing records&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Due to new specimen records and recent revisions of the taxon tables, there are ~5000 specimens across all recently updated collections that are currently being kicked out of the loading process due to the names being misspelled or unpublished.  This backlog is larger than in the past due to the cleaning up of the taxon tables. Fixing these problem names is a slow process that is being worked on periodically.  Many of these names also are cultivated taxa not yet in the taxon table.  If there are records for a taxon that were online previously and now are not, please e-mail me.  I can find why the record is being kicked out of the loading process and fix the problem before for the next refresh.</p>
<p class="bodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Image records&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This feature has not been updated since 2015, when David Baxter removed most image record links.  The links for most of the image records submitted in recent database updates have been restored.  The entire image file had to be recreated and revised.  The image links for UC and JEPS specimens are still broken and need to be reformatted again. Currently there are over 50,000 image links in the database, but over 30,000 of those are from SEINET.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. RSA POM
			Fixed bug in scripts showing incorrect combined collectors when only a single collector present.  This bug appears to have been in the loading script for some time and has escaped detection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;August 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAS-BOT-BC and SJSU updated<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. CAS-BOT-BC (formerly CAS and DS) has been revised further.  The error that resulted in mis-mapping of a majority of CAS specimens in the July refresh has mostly been fixed.  As a result of the new herbarium code and barcode numbers, no georeference buffer records cannot be applied to this collection at this time.  Therefore, there are 200,000+ records that are not georeferenced in this refresh that were mapped in July.<br />
A GIS-based fix for mapping the buffer coordinates (which use the old accession numbers) to the new herbarium codes is underway.  Most of the georeference buffer coordinates should be salvageable.	 There will be a considerable number of specimens left without coordinates after this fix.  These are old duplicate accessions that were kicked out previously, that after the change in herbarium codes, are now newly displayed on the CCH.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. More coordinates and specimens from CHSC and RSA/POM were added due to further revisions of the loading scripts. The loading scripts for these three herbaria will be completely updated by the end of August. This is a complicated process and if you see any errors or problems, please let us know.<br /><br />

<span class="bodyText"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;July 24  &mdash; CAS and DS (as CAS-BOT-BC), SCFS, SDSU, UCSC, and UCD updated<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The loading scripts for CDA, CHSC, and RSA/POM were partially updated to the new version. 
Only a small proportion of the georeferenced specimens were being mapped online since April (only those records that had just decimal latitude and longitude as coordinates).
The problem has now been corrected. The loading scripts for these three herbaria will be completely updated in August.
This is a complicated process and if you see any errors or problems, please let us know.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CAS/DS is now known as CAS-BOT-BC, as a result of their changeover to a Symbiota-based database. 
The new herbarium code and accessions in their recent update have overwritten all of the old accessions present in the previous versions of CCH. 
Additional fixes are underway to show the old CAS & DS accessions on the Accession Detail Results pages.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. A major update of the SEINET records from California were added in this refresh. 
The new upload includes many more specimen records (over 123,000 records) and herbaria than included previously. The SEINET loader has been updated to the current format. <br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Specimen records and georeferences from two new field station herbaria have been added to the CCH.
Specimens from BRFS (Blodgett Forest Research Station) and HREC (Hopland Research and Extension Center) were imaged and databased at UC-JEPS and will continue to be uploaded when the UC-JEPS data are refreshed.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Specimen records and georeferences from the Sagehen Creek Field Station herbarium (SCFS) have been added to the CCH. 
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Cleanup of the georeference buffer is mostly complete. 
The remaining georeference coordinates missing in the past update are present in this one. 
A previous issue with the georeferenced records from the Baldwin et al. 2017 study (see April 11, 2017 news above) overwriting georeferences from the primary buffer was corrected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;April 27  &mdash; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanup of the georeference buffer is mostly complete.  The remaining georeference coordinates missing in the past update are present in this one.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baja California records without coordinates now will show up in the CCH.  These were being removed by scripts in previous updates. There are a little over 6700 Baja records without georeferences, some of which are being georeferenced by CONABIO via a grant with the UC-JEPS Herbarium.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a problem with Baja California records with "unknown" municipality not being able to be distinguished from California records with "unknown" county.  This is due to the lack of a Country Field.  This is currently being worked on and will be enabled in a future update.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;April 18  &mdash; BLMAR, JROH, GMDRC, SD, UCR Updated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A revision of the data loading scripts of the above 4 participants plus CATA is complete. Phenology, habitat, associates, and other voucher data should now be displaying for these herbaria when present.  Additional updates to several other herbaria are in process. If you see any errors or problems, please let us know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivated Specimens are now fully included in CCH Queries, but Phase Two (ability to choose to not query cultivated specimens) is not yet implemented<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanup of data, yellow flagging, and georeferenced coordinates is ongoing.  Due to some changes with the georeferencing buffer process, the total georeferenced specimens is lower this update.  More cleanup of the georeference buffer is planned and additional georeference coordinates will re-appear in a future update<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Baja California records now have geocoordinates due to the georeferencing efforts of Jon Rebman and the SDNHM.<br />
