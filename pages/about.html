The Consortium of California Herbaria is the organization that supports all herbaria in California. Originally developed in 2003 around botanical collections from University of California herbaria, the Consortium has grown significantly and now includes records from <b>39 California institutions</b>. Membership is open to all California herbaria that agree to the terms of the MOU. Data providers need to meet this set of minimum requirements. Current members of CCH are listed at 
	<a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/participants.html">http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/participants.html</a>.  The California holdings of members are listed in a <a href="CCH_numbers_table.html">bar graph</a> and a <a href="CCH_numbers.html">chart</a>.<!--; the county record breakdown is depicted in a set of <a href="bargraphs/">bar graphs.--></p>
<p class="bodyText">Please send any feedback regarding the specimen data directly to the contact for each <a href="participants.html">member herbarium</a>.</p>
<br />
<p class="bodyText">The CCH began as a data aggregator for California vascular plant specimen data and that remains its primary purpose to date. Responding to requests from participants to display specimen data from all groups of plants and fungi, from all locations (including those outside California), we have developed a new portal. There are now two CCH portals and each has a special purpose.</p>
<br />
<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/"><b>The Consortium of California Herbaria 1 (CCH1)</b></a> serves as a gateway to information for California vascular plant specimens housed in herbaria, worldwide. Originally developed in 2003 around botanical collections from University of California herbaria, the Consortium has grown significantly and now contains over <b>2.2 million specimen records</b> from over 40 participants throughout North America. Records from Herbaria outside North America will be added in future updates. </p> 
<p class="bodyText"><b>CCH1</b> is an updated version of the original CCH portal.  CCH1 is a specialized portal for presenting highly curated specimen data about the California vascular flora, tightly linked to the active statewide flora project (the Jepson eFlora: http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/). It is restricted to vascular plant specimens of native and naturalized taxa from California. This portal will include all California vascular plants from CCH members, but will also include California specimen records from other sources worldwide. The Index of California Plants Names (ICPN) will continue to be developed to record details about each the different categories of names for these taxa and will be used for both the Jepson eFlora and CCH1.</p>
<p class="bodyText">For more information about CCH1, see our article  
	<a href="/common/php/Fremontia_Vol44No1_MarkosMoeBaxter.pdf">A Powerful Resource for Plant Conservation Efforts: The Consortium of California Herbaria Reaches Two Million Specimens</a>, published in <a href="http://www.cnps.org/cnps/publications/fremontia/">Fremontia</a> (2016).</p>
<br />

<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://cch2.org/portal/"><b>The Consortium of California Herbaria 2 (CCH2)</b></a> serves as a gateway to information for herbarium specimens housed in California herbaria.  CCH2 will be a general Symbiota portal for managing and presenting data from CCH members.  This portal will serve all specimen data from all participating CCH members and will be worldwide scope and have a broad taxonomic coverage of land plants, algae, and fungi. Unlike the original CCH database, some members will use CCH2 for data entry and collections management directly and they will be responsible for their own data quality control.  In the next 4 years, CCH2 will add nearly a million images of specimens from California Herbaria.  Additionally, the portal will capture phenological data: information about the timing of, e.g., flowering or fruiting.</p>
